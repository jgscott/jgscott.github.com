I am a statistician and data scientist.  My research interests are
mainly in modern computational methods and in Bayesian inference.
I've done recent work on data-augmentation schemes for Bayesian
computation; scalable algorithms; multiple testing and
high-dimensional screening problems; prior choice in hierarchical
models; and Bayesian methods in machine learning.  See my
[Papers](papers.html) and [Software](software.html) pages for more
detail.  

My recent collaborative projects have involved applications in health
care, security, and neuroscience.  I've also done work in linguistics,
political science, infectious disease, astronomy, and molecular
biology.
