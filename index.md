# About me
I am a statistician and data scientist.  My research interests are mainly in modern computational methods and in Bayesian inference.  I've done recent work on data-augmentation schemes for Bayesian computation; scalable algorithms; multiple testing and high-dimensional screening problems; prior choice in hierarchical models; and Bayesian methods in machine learning.

My recent collaborative projects have involved applications in health care, security, and neuroscience.  I've also done work in linguistics, political science, infectious disease, astronomy, and molecular biology.  My full CV is [here](files/jamesscottcv.pdf).
