## R Walk-throughs

### Introduction to R
* [Installing R](r/basics/installing_R.html): installing R.  
* [Heights of students versus their parents](r/heights/heights.html): a "hello world"-style introduction to the R environment.  

### Exploratory data analysis
* [Survival on the Titanic](r/titanic/titanic.html): basics of contingency tables.  
* [Temperatures in San Diego and Rapid City](r/citytemps/citytemps.html): measuring and visualizing dispersion; changing default plots in R.
* [SAT scores and GPA at UT-Austin](r/sat/sat.html): boxplots, residuals, fitted values, groupwise means, scatter plots, and lattice plots.    

### Fitting simple equations to data
* [Asking prices of pickup trucks on Craigslist](r/pickup/pickup.html): simple linear regression via ordinary least squares; residual summaries   
* [Utility bills versus temperature](r/utilities/utilities.html): adding polynomial terms to fit nonlinear curves  
* [Infant mortality and GDP](r/infmort/infmort.html): using log transformations to fit power laws via linear least squares      
* [Kidney function and aging](r/creatinine/creatinine.html): naive prediction intervals; R^2 and the decomposition of variance     

### Regression with multiple categorical variables  
* [Reaction time in video games](r/rxntime/rxntime.html): modeling numerical outcomes with more than one categorical predictor; dummy variables and interaction terms; analysis of variance.  
* [House prices](r/house/house.html): regression with one numerical and multiple categorical predictors; dummy variables and interactions in simple regression models.  


### Quantifying uncertainty: the basics   
* [Gone fishing](r/gonefishing/gonefishing.html): using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the sampling distributions of the sample mean and of the least-squares estimator  
* [Kidney function and aging, revisited](r/creatinine/creatinine_bootstrap.html): bootstrapping the sample mean and the OLS estimator; computing confidence intervals from bootstrapped samples.  
* [Newspapers](r/newspapers/newspapers.html): using the normal linear regression model to quantify uncertainty about parameters and predictions.    
* [Titanic, revisited](r/titanic/titanic_permtest.html): relative risk, odds ratios, and permutation tests in 2x2 contingency tables.  


### Multiple regression  
* [The wage gap](r/salary/salary.html): an introduction to multiple regression  
* [Current population survey](r/cps/cps.html): ANOVA tables in multiple regression models; stepwise selection using AIC
