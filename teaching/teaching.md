## R Walk-throughs

I use R in all my courses, and over the years I've built up a library of teaching scripts.  In 2015 I'm converting these to R Markdown as each one comes up in class.  Here are the ones I've gotten to so far.  You can find the raw R markdown files through my GitHub page.

### Basics
* [Heights of students versus their parents](r/heights/heights.html): a "hello world"-style introduction to the R environment.  
* [Survival on the Titanic](r/titanic/titanic.html): basics of contingency tables.  
* [Temperatures in San Diego and Rapid City](r/citytemps/citytemps.html): measuring and visualizing dispersion; changing default plots in R.
* [SAT scores and GPA at UT-Austin](r/sat/sat.html): boxplots, residuals, fitted values, groupwise means, scatter plots, and lattice plots.    

### Ordinary least squares with one predictor
* [Asking prices of pickup trucks on Craigslist](r/pickup/pickup.html): simple linear regression via ordinary least squares, residual summaries   
* [Infant mortality and GDP](r/infmort/infmort.html): using log transformations to fit power laws via linear least squares   
* [Utility bills versus temperature](r/utilities/utilities.html): add polynomial terms to fit nonlinear curves
