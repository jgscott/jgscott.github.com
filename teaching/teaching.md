## To students interested in SDS 385 (Fall 2016)

I have received a very large number of e-mails from students interested in SDS 385 (Statistical Models for Big Data) for Fall 2016.  I cannot feasibly respond to every one individually.  I am sorry for this, but here is what I would say if I could:  
* the course is designed for students in four programs: biology, statistics, computer science, and biomedical engineering.  If you are not in one of these four programs, I will not give permission for you to be added to the course at this time (spring or summer 2016).  
* I do not have a syllabus or list of topics at this time.  It is a brand new course, and I will be preparing these materials over the summer.  
* the course focuses on methods appropriate for biology and biomedical applications, with a few other applications in the hard sciences.  If you are interested in taking the course because you want to learn a software stack for big-data applications in industry, you will possibly end up disappointed.  
* the course will nonetheless still teach methods appropriate for big-data applications in a wider range of fields.  There just won't be our focus.  
* students in other programs are welcome to enroll... eventually.  But you have to wait until the fall add/drop period so that students in the four core programs served by the course receive priority.  



## Current Courses (Spring 2016)

* [SDS 325H: Honors Statistics](/SDS325H_Spring2016/)

Last year's sites:  
* [SDS 383D: Statistical Modeling II](/SDS383D_Spring2015/)  
* [STA 380: Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/jgscott/STA380)   

## R Walk-throughs

I use R in all my courses, and over the years I've built up a library of teaching scripts.  Since 2015 I've been converting these to R Markdown as each one comes up in class.  [Here are the ones I've gotten to so far.](r/Rwalkthroughs.html)  You can find the raw R markdown files through my [GitHub page.](http://www.github.com/jgscott/)

## Case studies

I have built up a library of data-analysis case studies, which I am slowly migrating to this website.  [You can find them here.](cases/cases.html)


## What should a write-up look like?

I am often asked by students: what do you expect from a write-up of a data analysis that's been assigned in class?  [Here are some thoughts.](misc/write_ups.html).
