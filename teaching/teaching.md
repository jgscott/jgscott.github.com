## R Walk-throughs

I use R in all my courses, and over the years I've built up a library of teaching scripts.  In 2015 I'm converting these to R Markdown as each one comes up in class.  Here are the ones I've gotten to so far.  You can find the raw R markdown files through my GitHub page.

### Basics
* [heights](r/heights/heights.html): a "hello world"-style introduction to the R environment.  
* [titanic](r/titanic/titanic.html): basics of contingency tables.  
* [citytemps](r/citytemps/citytemps.html): measuring and visualizing dispersion; changing default plots.  
* [sat](r/sat/sat.html): boxplots, scatter plots, and lattice plots.
