## R Walk-throughs

I use R in all my courses, and over the years I've built up a library of teaching scripts.  Since 2015 I've been converting these to R Markdown as each one comes up in class.  [Here are the ones I've gotten to so far.](R/Rwalkthroughs.html)  You can find the raw R markdown files through my [GitHub page.](http://www.github.com/jgscott/)
