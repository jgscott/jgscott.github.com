## R Walk-throughs

I use R in all my courses, and over the years I've built up a library of teaching scripts.  In 2015 I'm converting these to R Markdown as each one comes up in class.  Here are the ones I've gotten to so far.  You can find the raw R markdown files through my GitHub page.

### Basics of exploratory data analysis
* [Heights of students versus their parents](r/heights/heights.html): a "hello world"-style introduction to the R environment.  
* [Survival on the Titanic](r/titanic/titanic.html): basics of contingency tables.  
* [Temperatures in San Diego and Rapid City](r/citytemps/citytemps.html): measuring and visualizing dispersion; changing default plots in R.
* [SAT scores and GPA at UT-Austin](r/sat/sat.html): boxplots, residuals, fitted values, groupwise means, scatter plots, and lattice plots.    

### Ordinary least squares with one predictor
* [Asking prices of pickup trucks on Craigslist](r/pickup/pickup.html): simple linear regression via ordinary least squares; residual summaries   
* [Infant mortality and GDP](r/infmort/infmort.html): using log transformations to fit power laws via linear least squares   
* [Utility bills versus temperature](r/utilities/utilities.html): adding polynomial terms to fit nonlinear curves     
* [Kidney function and aging](r/creatinine/creatinine.html): naive prediction intervals; R^2 and the decomposition of variance     

### Regression with multiple categorical varaibles  
* [Reaction time in video games](r/rxntime/rxntime.html): modeling numerical outcomes with more than one categorical predictor; dummy variables and interaction terms; analysis of variance.  
* [House prices](r/house/house.html): regression with one numerical and multiple categorical predictors; dummy variables and interactions in simple regression models.  


### Quantifying uncertainty: the basics   
* [Gone fishing](r/gonefishing/gonefishing.html): using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the sampling distributions of the sample mean and of the least-squares estimator  
* [Kidney function and aging, revisited](r/creatinine/creatinine_bootstrap.html): bootstrapping the sample mean and the OLS estimator; computing confidence intervals from bootstrapped samples.  


## Case studies  
* [Traffic fatalities](r/trafficdeaths/trafficdeaths.html): predictors of state-level traffic fatalities   
* [Circuit-board manufacturing](r/solder/solder.html): predictors of manufacturing flaws in AT&T circuit boards
