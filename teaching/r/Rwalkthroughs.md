## R Walkthroughs

### Introduction to R
* [Installing R](basics/installing_R.html): installing R and RStudio.  
* [Heights of students versus their parents](heights/heights.html): a "hello world"-style introduction to the R environment.  
* [Installing a library](basics/installing_library.html): installing the mosaic library from within RStudio.  


### Exploratory data analysis
