## Approximating the sampling distribution by bootstrapping
  
Learning goals:  
* bootstrap the sample mean  
* bootstrap the OLS estimator  
* compute and interpret the bootstrapped standard error  
* compute confidence intervals from bootstrapped samples  

Data files:  
* [creatinine.csv](creatinine.csv): data on age and kidney function for 157 adult males from a single clinic.

Load the mosaic library and then return to the creatinine data set, which we recall had data on the age and kidney function for a sample of men from a single clinic.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
```

```{r}
creatinine = read.csv('creatinine.csv', header=TRUE)
summary(creatinine)
```

The two variables are   
* age: the patient's age.  
* creatclear: the  patient's creatinine-clearance rate, measured in ml/minute.


### Bootstrapped samples 

We will start by addressing the following question.  What can we say about the average creatinine-clearance rate for the population of men who attend this clinic, on the basis of this particular sample of 157?  The sample mean is easy enough to compute:
```{r}
creatclear_samplemean = mean(creatinine$creatclear)
creatclear_samplemean
```

But we know that our sample mean of 125 won't exactly equal the population mean.  To quantify how far off our estimate is likely to be, we would like to know the standard error of the sample mean. Moreover, we'd like to know this without taking many more samples of 157 from the population and seeing how the sample mean changes from one sample to the next.

The idea of the bootstrap is to pretend that your sample represents the whole population.  We then take repeated "bootstrapped" samples from the original sample.  Each bootstrapped sample is defined by two properties:  
1) It has the same size as the original sample.  
2) It is a sample with replacement from the original sample.   Because we sample with replacement, it is inevitable that our bootstrapped sample will contain ties and omissions.  That is, some points from the original sample will get picked more than once, and some won't get picked at all.  This approximates the process of taking repeated real samples from the whole population.  

Let's see this in action.  First, let's create a bootstrapped sample and look at the first 20 data points.  We'll do this using the `sample` command.
```{r}
bootstrapped_sample = sample(creatinine, size = 157, replace=TRUE)
head(bootstrapped_sample, 20)
```
If you look carefully, you may see a repeated entry in these first 20 rows.  That's because our bootstrapped sample is a sample with replacement from the original sample.  You can visualize the pattern of ties and omissions with the following plot:
```{r}
plot(table(bootstrapped_sample$orig.id))
```

The height of each bar shows how many times that original data point was picked.  The gaps show data points that were omitted.

There's actually a more concise way to draw bootstrapped samples using the `resample` command, which we'll use from now on.  Try executing the following block of code 5 or 10 times to get a feel for the different patterns of ties and omissions that arise in each bootstrapped sample.
```{r}
# same as sample(creatinine, size = 157, replace=TRUE)
bootstrapped_sample = resample(creatinine)  
plot(table(bootstrapped_sample$orig.id))
```

### Bootstrapping the sample mean

We're now ready to estimate the sampling distribution of the sample mean by bootstrapping.  Our basic procedure is:  
1) Take a bootstrap sample from the original sample.  
2) For this bootstrapped sample, we compute the sample mean of the creatinine-clearance rate.  

We repeat this process a large number of times (say, 1000 or more).  The key point is that, because each bootstrapped sample has a unique pattern of ties and omissions, each will have a different sample mean.  The histogram of sample means across the bootstrapped samples then gives us an idea of how the sample mean changes from sample to sample.

Try executing the following block of code 5-10 times to see the different sample means you get for each bootstrapped sample.
```{r}
bootstrapped_sample = resample(creatinine)
mean(bootstrapped_sample$creatclear)
```

The final trick is to use the `do` command to automatic the process of taking repeated bootstrapped samples and computing the sample mean for each one.
```{r}
do(10)*{
  bootstrapped_sample = resample(creatinine)  # same as sample(creatinine, size = 157, replace=TRUE)
  mean(bootstrapped_sample$creatclear)
}
```
If this looks unfamiliar, try revisiting the ["Gone fishing"](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/gonefishing/gonefishing.html) walkthrough to remind yourself of the logic of the `do(10)*` command.

Now we're ready.  Let's take 1000 bootstrapped samples, compute the sample mean for each one and visualize the results.  
```{r}
# Take bootstrapped samples
myboot = do(1000)*{
  bootstrapped_sample = resample(creatinine)  # same as sample(creatinine, size = 157, replace=TRUE)
  mean(bootstrapped_sample$creatclear)
}
# Visualize the sampling distribution and compute the bootstrapped standard error
hist(myboot$result)
sd(myboot$result)
```

Because we have different bootstrapped samples, your histogram and estimated standard error will look slightly different from mine.  But they should be relatively close.

Incidentally, if you repeatedly execute the above code block, you'll get slightly different histograms and standard errors each time.  We refer to this variability as "Monte Carlo error," to distinguish it from the standard error of the estimator itself.  In principle, you can drive the Monte Carlo error to virtually nothing by taking a very large number of bootstrapped samples. 


### Bootstrapping the OLS estimator  

Once you get the hang of bootstrapping the sample mean, you can bootstrap just about anything.  As a specific example, we will approximate the sampling distribution of the least-squares estimator for the relationship between creatinine clearance rate and age:
```{r}
# Plot the data
plot(creatclear~age, data=creatinine)
# Fit a straight line to the data by least squares
lm1 = lm(creatclear~age, data=creatinine)
# Extract the coefficients and plot the line
coef(lm1)
abline(lm1)
```

Let's warm-up by computing the OLS estimator for a single bootstrapped sample.  Try executing this code block 5-10 different times:
```{r}
lm_boot = lm(creatclear~age, data=resample(creatinine))
lm_boot
```
Notice how the slope and intercept of the fitted line change for each sample.

To get a good idea of the sampling distribution for these quantities, we want to repeat this many more than 5-10 times.  Let's now use the `do` command to automate the whole process and save the result.

```{r}
myboot2 = do(1000)*{
  lm_boot = lm(creatclear~age, data=resample(creatinine))
  lm_boot
}
# Inspect the first several lines
head(myboot2)
```

Notice that we have separate columns for the intercept, slope on the age variable, sigma (the residual standard deviation), and R-squared.  (Don't worry about the "F" column for now.)  Let's visualize the sampling distributions for the intercept and slope.
```{r}
hist(myboot2$Intercept)
sd(myboot2$Intercept)
hist(myboot2$age)
sd(myboot2$age)
```


### Confidence intervals

We've met coverage intervals before.  A coverage interval is an interval that covers a specified percentage (say 80% or 95%) of a distribution.

A confidence interval for a parameter is nothing but a coverage interval for that parameter's sampling distribution.  For example, let's look more closely at the sampling distribution for the slope on the `age` variable that we just approximated by bootstrapping.  We'll plot the histogram, compute the endpoints of an 80% coverage interval, and show these endpoints on the plot.
```{r}
hist(myboot2$age)
myinterval = quantile(myboot2$age, probs=c(0.1, 0.9))
abline(v = myinterval, col='blue')
myinterval
```
We would refer to this interval as an 80% confidence interval for the slope of the age variable in our regression model.  (As above, your numbers won't match mine exactly because of the randomness inherent to bootstrapping.  But they should be close.)  Note that this confidence interval is very different from an 80% coverage interval of the actual ages in the underlying sample:
```{r}
quantile(creatinine$age, probs=c(0.1, 0.9))
```

You can use the `confint` command to quickly get confidence intervals for all model parameters:
```{r}
confint(myboot2, level=0.8)
```
You will notice that this gives a slightly different answer to the confidence interval we calculated from the quantiles, above.  That's because the default behavior of the `confint' function is to give a confidence interval that is symmetric about the sample mean.  That is, we take the mean of the histogram and step out symmetrically to either side until we cover 80% of the sampling distribution; we call this a "central" confindence interval.  The 80% interval we computed above, on the other hand, contained exactly 10% of the bootstrapped samples in each tail of the histogram; we call this an "equal-tail" confidence interval.  Neither is better than the other; they are simply different conventions.  In the special case where the underlying sampling distribution is exactly symmetric, then the two conventions will give the same answer.
