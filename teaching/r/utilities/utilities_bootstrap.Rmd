### Bootstrapping

In this walk-through, you'll learn about bootstrapping, a useful technique for quantifying uncertainty in statistical models.  Bootstrapping is known as a "resampling" technique.  It leverages the power of modern computers to simulate a sampling distribution by resampling from your data set.

Data files:  
* [utilities.csv](utilities.csv): monthly gas bill versus temperature for a house in Minnesota.  

First let's load the mosaic library and read in the utilities data set.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
utilities = read.csv('utilities.csv', header=TRUE)
```

A quick summary:
```{r}
summary(utilities)
```
