(2014) FDR smoothing. Exploits spatial structure in multiple-testing problem with test statistics on a spatial lattice or arbitrary graph.  [On Github](https://github.com/tansey/smoothfdr).  All the hard work by [Wes Tansey](https://github.com/tansey).  

(2014) FDRreg. Tools for false-discovery rate problems, including
false-discovery rate regression (whereby covariates can influence
local FDR). [On CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FDRreg/index.html),
with the latest incremental updates
[on GitHub](https://github.com/jgscott/FDRreg).  

(2014) helloPG.  An R package skeleton for incorporating the Polya-Gamma distribution into your own code or package.  Not a package per se, and thus not on CRAN, but the latest updates [on GitHub](https://github.com/jgscott/helloPG).  This uses the PG simulation routines originally written by Jesse for BayesLogit (see below).

(2012) [BayesLogit:][1] Bayesian modeling of discrete outcomes via
logistic and negative-binomial regression using Polya-Gamma data
augmentation. All the hard work by [Jesse Windle. ][2]  

(2012) [ BayesBridge:][3] Bayesian bridge regression. All the hard work by [Jesse Windle](https://github.com/jwindle).
