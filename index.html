  <h1>About</h1>  
  <p>
  I work mainly in the area of Bayesian inference.  My current methodological research spans several areas:
    (1) data-augmentation schemes for Bayesian computation; (2) scalability of algorithms for posterior inference;
    (3) model selection and multiple testing; (4) prior choice in
  Bayesian shrinkage estimation; and (5) Bayesian methods in machine learning.
    My recent collaborative projects have involved linguistics,
  political science, corporate strategy, finance, neuroscience,
  infectious disease, astronomy, and molecular biology.
